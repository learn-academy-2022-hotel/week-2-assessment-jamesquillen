# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer:

Parameters and methods are both related to functions and methods. Functions and methods often, but not always, have parameters and arguments. I will refer to a function fom now own, but the same information applies to methods. When a function is created and needs some type of data introduced into it to perform its job, a parameter is added. Parameters are placeholders for mandatory or optional data to be fed into a function. The presence of a parameter indicates that some kind of information needs to be provided to the function so the function can then act upon that information. Paramters allow functions to be dynamic since many placeholders can be fed into function and not hard coded into the statement of the funciton itself. Parameters can also be optional and allow for a function to change its output or change how it performs its task, depending on how the parameters are set up. 

Arguments are the actual data inputted into the parameter placeholders when a function is called. If a function has a paramter for a name, the argument would be "John" or some other name. If a function has two parameters and performs the function of adding the two parameters together, the arguements would be two acual numbers. 

Parameters and arguments are closely related. If a parameter is the blank space in a Madlib asking for a noun, the arguement is whatever noun the Madlib player chooses.

Researched answer:

Functions have three parts: a name, paramter(s), and a statement (code block). While parameters are optional, without them functionality is limited. Parameters are formal argument names. Paramters must be strings and separated by commas if there are more than one. These parameters are passed to the function where the statement performs some sort of action on them. 

Arguments are the real, inputted values of a function's parameter(s). Mandatory parameters will need to be given arguments for the parent function to run correctly, while optional arguments are not striclty required for a function to work.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer:

The .map() method iterates over and array and performs wahetever arguments are inputted to each element in that array. I know of two parameters for this method. The first, and only, required parameter is the value of the element in the array. Since every element in the array is acted upon with the method, the values of every item needs to be passed into the method. For example, if every element of an array of strings needed to be turned to all upercase letters, the .toUpperCase() method would need to be called for every element in the array. The only way to pass .toUppCase() to every element would be to have access to the value of every element in the array. And the only way to have access to the value of every element in the array is the use the first mandatory parameter of the .map() method. A second, optional array paramter is the index. I think this paramter returns the indexes of the array in addition to the values, but I have not used this parameter so I am not entirely sure.

Researched answer:

The .map() function creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. This method has three parameters: element, index, and array. The element is each element of the array, the index is each index of the array, and the array is the array itself. The functions purpose and desired output will determine which parameters are used. For a simple away, the element paramater must be used to accomplish any kind of functionality. If the values insides an array are never accessed, there would be no puspose in calling the .map() method.
